# Todo App

A simple todo app that utilizes server actions (the ability to add/check off todos on the server without JS)

## Server Actions

Using the ["action" attribtue](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/action) of a form elemenmt, form data can be sent to the server to be processed, rather than the client. The sever can then respond with updated HTML rendered on the server.

Benifits to this include security, etc. Read more at https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations
